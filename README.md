# CLI Wordle Game
---
A simple implementation of a Wordle-like game playable from a command line prompt.

Code files:
- wordle.py : contains the main implementation;
- dictionary.py : contains a **long** list of 5-letter english words to pick from for each game;
- alphabet.py : contains a list of all the english letters used to display the "keyboard" at each pass.
